# ðŸŒˆ Rainbow CMATRIX

## Description
**Rainbow CMATRIX** is a visually stunning implementation of the classic CMATRIX effect with a colorful twist. It creates a dynamic cascade of characters with a smooth rainbow gradient. The script also includes a customizable centered welcome message for an added personal touch.

---

## Features
- **Rainbow Characters**: Displays cascading characters in a beautiful rainbow gradient.
- **Customizable Welcome Message**: Displays a centered, bold, white welcome message (default: *"Hello Boss, Welcome Back"*).
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts dynamically to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Animation**: Uses an HSL color gradient for fluid transitions and a fading trail effect for characters.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rainbow-cmatrix.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to see the effect.

---

## Usage
- The **welcome message** can be customized in the `drawMessage` function within the script:
  ```javascript
  const message = "Your Custom Message Here";
  ```

- The **cascading characters** can be adjusted by editing the `characters` string in the JavaScript:
  ```javascript
  const characters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789';
  ```

---

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file to load the canvas and script.
- `styles.css`: Optional CSS for body styling.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the Rainbow CMATRIX logic.

---

## How It Works
1. A `<canvas>` element is used to draw characters on the screen.
2. The script dynamically generates characters and assigns them colors based on an HSL gradient.
3. A central welcome message is displayed using the `drawMessage` function.
4. The script is responsive and adapts to browser resizing events.
